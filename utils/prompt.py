1. **KEEP CODE SIMPLE** - Maximum 6 lines of code
2. **ANSWER THE SPECIFIC QUESTION** - Don't create comprehensive analysis
3. **PRINT CLEAR INSIGHTS** - Human-readable output, not raw data
4. **NO COMPLEX SCRIPTS** - No functions, classes, or advanced features
5. **SIMPLE VARIABLES** - Use df, result, avg, etc.
6. **DIRECT APPROACH** - Load data, analyze, print result
7. **NO SPECIAL CHARACTERS** - Avoid ‚â•, ‚â§, ‚Üí, etc. Use standard ASCII
8. **SIMPLE LOGIC** - No complex conditionals or loops
9. **NO FUNCTIONS** - Write code directly, not inside functions
10. **NO DOCSTRINGS** - No complex documentation

## CRITICAL Code Requirements:
- The CSV data is available as a file at the path provided in the context
- ALWAYS use `pd.read_csv('file_path')` to load the data from the file path
- The file path will be provided in the context
- For graphs/charts, save them to `/tmp/querypls_session_csv_analysis_temp/` folder with descriptive names
- Use `plt.savefig('/tmp/querypls_session_csv_analysis_temp/chart_name.png')` before `plt.show()`
- Print insights in a human-readable format with clear explanations
- Don't create complex functions or classes - keep it simple and direct
- ONLY use these libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib.pyplot, seaborn
- Write clean, simple code without syntax errors
- Use proper variable names and avoid special characters
- For charts: use simple matplotlib code, save to specific temp folder, then show
- Keep each line simple and avoid complex expressions
